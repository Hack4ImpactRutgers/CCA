# Combined Community Action Frontend

## Getting Started

If it is not already installed on your machine, install [`pnpm`](https://pnpm.io/):

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

Then, install dependencies:
```bash
pnpm install
```

Finally, start the development server:
```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Deployments

A new deployment of the app is created on every push to `main`. Visit the latest iteration [here](https://cca-frontend.vercel.app).

## Testing

We write our tests using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/). To run all tests:

pnpm test
```
